This project is made by Machine Learning in Python  Also, the user interface of this project is built from Python's streamlit library.

Description:-

The "Diamonds Price Prediction" project leverages the power of machine learning to accurately forecast the prices of diamonds. With the diamond market being highly dynamic and influenced by various factors, this project aims to provide reliable predictions to assist buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions.

The project involves several key steps. Firstly, the dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables, ensuring the data is in a suitable format for training the machine learning model. Feature engineering techniques may also be employed to extract additional relevant information and enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.
